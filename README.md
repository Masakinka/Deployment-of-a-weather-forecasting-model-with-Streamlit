# Deployment of a Weather Forecasting Model with Streamlit

This project demonstrates the deployment of a machine learning model that predicts whether it will rain tomorrow using weather data. The model is trained on the **Australian weather dataset** from Kaggle and implemented with **Scikit-learn**. The web interface is built with **Streamlit** for ease of interaction.

## Key Features
- **Model Training and Data Processing**: The model uses various weather features like temperature, rainfall, sunshine, and cloud cover to make predictions.
- **Interactive User Interface**: The app allows users to input weather conditions and get real-time predictions on whether it will rain tomorrow.
- **Probability of Rain**: Alongside the prediction, the app provides the probability of rain based on the input values.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn** for the machine learning model
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Joblib** for model serialization
- **Streamlit** for the web application deployment
